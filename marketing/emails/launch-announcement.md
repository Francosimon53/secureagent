Hi there,

Big news: **SecureAgent is officially live!**

We've been building something different - an AI assistant that doesn't just talk, but actually takes action.

### What can SecureAgent do?

**🌐 Browse the web for you**
"Go to Hacker News and summarize the top stories" - it navigates, extracts, and summarizes. No copy/paste needed.

**⏰ Run scheduled automations**
"Every morning at 9am, check my calendar and send me a briefing" - works while you sleep.

**📱 Work everywhere you are**
Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Web chat, and Voice calls. Your conversations sync across all of them.

**🧠 Choose your AI model**
Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and 100+ more. Use the best model for each task.

**🔐 Enterprise-grade security**
OWASP compliant, Zero Trust architecture, fully open source. Your data stays yours.
