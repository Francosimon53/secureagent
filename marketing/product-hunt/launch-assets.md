## First Comment from Maker

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm thrilled to launch SecureAgent today - the AI assistant I wish existed when I started automating my life.

**Why I built this:**
I was frustrated with AI chatbots that could only... chat. I needed an assistant that could:
- Actually browse the web and extract data
- Send me scheduled updates (news, weather, reminders)
- Control my smart home devices
- Work across all my messaging apps

So I built SecureAgent.

**What makes it different:**
1. **Multi-channel** - One AI, everywhere you are (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Web)
2. **Browser automation** - It can navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots
3. **Scheduled tasks** - Set up automations like "Every morning at 9am, summarize my emails"
4. **Enterprise security** - OWASP compliant, Zero Trust architecture
5. **Open source** - Full transparency, self-host if you want

**Launch special:** 50% off for the first 3 months with code PRODUCTHUNT50

I'd love your feedback! What automations would you build?
