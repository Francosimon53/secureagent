## About SecureAgent

SecureAgent is an enterprise-grade AI assistant that goes beyond conversation. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that can only provide information, SecureAgent can actually take action - browsing websites, running scheduled automations, controlling smart home devices, and working across multiple messaging platforms.

### One-Liner
An AI assistant that actually DOES things, not just talks.

### Tagline

Built with enterprise-grade security, it enables users to automate workflows, gather information from the web, and interact with their AI across Telegram, Discord, Slack, and more. SecureAgent supports 100+ AI models including Claude, GPT-4, and open-source alternatives.
