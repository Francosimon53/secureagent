I built an AI assistant that actually DOES things - browser automation, scheduled tasks, multi-channel support

### Post

Hey r/artificial!

I just launched SecureAgent, and I'd love your feedback.

**The problem I was solving:**
Most AI assistants can only chat. You ask them to do something, they tell you how, and then you have to do it yourself. I wanted an AI that could actually take action.

**What SecureAgent does:**

1. **Browser Automation** - Navigate websites, extract data, fill forms, take screenshots. Example: "Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 stories" - it actually does it.

2. **Scheduled Tasks** - Set up automations that run automatically. "Every morning at 9am, check my calendar and send me a briefing" - works while you sleep.

3. **Multi-Channel** - Works on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and Web. Conversations sync across all platforms.

4. **100+ AI Models** - Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek, and more via OpenRouter. Use the best model for each task.

5. **Enterprise Security** - OWASP compliant, Zero Trust architecture. Fully open source so you can verify.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Puppeteer for browser automation
- Multiple LLM providers via unified API
- Telegram/Discord/Slack bot integrations

**Open Source:** https://github.com/Francosimon53/secureagent

**Try it:** https://secureagent.vercel.app

Would love to hear what automations you'd build with this. Also happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.

[Launch] SecureAgent - AI assistant with browser automation and scheduled tasks (open source)

### Post

Hey everyone!

After months of building on nights and weekends, I finally launched my side project: **SecureAgent**.

**What is it?**
An AI assistant that goes beyond chatting - it can actually browse the web, run scheduled tasks, and work across multiple messaging platforms.

**The story:**
I was tired of AI assistants that could only talk. I'd ask ChatGPT how to do something, get great instructions, and then have to do all the work myself. I wanted an AI that could just... do the thing.

**Key features:**
- Browser automation (navigate sites, extract data, fill forms)
- Scheduled tasks (daily digests, weekly reports, monitoring)
- Multi-channel (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Web)
- 100+ AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
- Enterprise security (open source, self-hostable)

**Tech stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Puppeteer for browser automation
- Vercel for hosting
- Stripe for billing

**Pricing:**
- Free tier: 30 messages/month
- Starter: $19/mo
- Pro: $49/mo

Using PRODUCTHUNT50 gets you 50% off for 3 months.

Happy to answer any questions about the build process, tech decisions, or anything else!

- Starter: $19/mo (300 messages)
- Pro: $49/mo (1,000 messages)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

**Current Status:**
- Just launched on Product Hunt
- First 10 paying customers goal
- MRR target: $1,000 by end of month

**Stack:**
- Next.js + TypeScript + Vercel

- Open source core

**Marketing Plan:**
1. Product Hunt launch (today)

Would love feedback on the product and landing page. What would make you sign up? What's missing?
