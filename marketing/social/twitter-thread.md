# SecureAgent Launch - Twitter/X Thread

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I just launched SecureAgent - an AI assistant that actually DOES things, not just talks.

Here's what makes it different from ChatGPT, and why I built it:

🧵 (1/10)

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
The problem with most AI assistants:

They can write, analyze, and answer questions...

But they can't actually DO anything.

You still have to:
- Copy/paste their outputs
- Manually execute their suggestions
- Check back for updates yourself

I wanted AI that ACTS. (2/10)

## Tweet 3 (Solution intro)
So I built SecureAgent.

An AI assistant that:
- Browses the web for you
- Sends you scheduled updates
- Controls your smart home
- Works on Telegram, Discord, Slack

All with enterprise-grade security. (3/10)

## Tweet 4 (Feature 1: Browser)
🌐 BROWSER AUTOMATION

"Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 stories"

SecureAgent actually navigates to the site, extracts the data, and summarizes it.

No copy/paste. No manual work.

Just results. (4/10)

## Tweet 5 (Feature 2: Scheduling)
⏰ SCHEDULED TASKS

"Every morning at 9am, check my calendar and give me a briefing"

Set it once. Get updates automatically.

Your AI works even while you sleep.

Examples:
- Daily news digest
- Weekly reports
- Price monitoring
- Social media summaries (5/10)

## Tweet 6 (Feature 3: Multi-channel)
📱 MULTI-CHANNEL

One AI, everywhere you are:

- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack
- WhatsApp
- Web chat
- Voice calls

Switch between channels seamlessly.

Your conversation history syncs across all of them. (6/10)

## Tweet 7 (Feature 4: Security)
🔐 ENTERPRISE SECURITY

Most AI tools are black boxes.

SecureAgent is:
- OWASP Top 10 compliant
- Zero Trust architecture
- Fully open source
- Self-hostable

Your data stays yours. (7/10)

## Tweet 8 (Feature 5: Models)
🧠 100+ AI MODELS

Not locked into one provider.

Choose from:
- Claude
- GPT-4
- Gemini
- Llama
- DeepSeek
- And 100+ more via OpenRouter

Use the best model for each task. (8/10)
