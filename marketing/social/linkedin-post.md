# SecureAgent Launch - LinkedIn Post

## Post

I'm excited to announce the launch of **SecureAgent** - an AI assistant that actually DOES things, not just talks.

After months of building, I realized the problem with most AI assistants: they can write, analyze, and answer questions... but they can't actually DO anything. You still have to copy/paste outputs, manually execute suggestions, and constantly check back.

So I built SecureAgent.

**What makes it different:**

🌐 **Browser Automation** - It navigates websites, extracts data, fills forms. "Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 stories" - done.

⏰ **Scheduled Tasks** - Set up automations that run while you sleep. Daily news digests, weekly reports, price monitoring.

📱 **Multi-Channel** - One AI across Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and Web. Your conversations sync everywhere.

🔐 **Enterprise Security** - OWASP Top 10 compliant, Zero Trust architecture, fully open source.

🧠 **100+ AI Models** - Choose from Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and more via OpenRouter.

**Launch special:** 50% off your first 3 months with code PRODUCTHUNT50
